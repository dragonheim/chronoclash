# Zones
## Initial Zone Descriptions & Details
### 1. Seattle - The Last City
*   **Eras Mixed:** Modern
*   **Size:** Small (3sq KM city)
*   **Core Concept:** Somehow the city of Seattle has remained relatively intact, a bastion of modern civilization amidst the chaos. It is a sprawling urban environment with towering skyscrapers, advanced technology, and a diverse population of survivors from the Modern era. The city is a hub for trade, diplomacy, and conflict between various factions vying for control. All monsters in this zone are modern tech, and exclusively common and uncommon. This zone is designed for individuals or small groups to learn the mechanics of the game and explore the world. Seattle is the starting zone for all players and the magjority of solo quests. This is also where equipment and crafting are introduced, as well as the first introduction to the Chrono-Walkers.
*  **Accomodations:** The city has a variety of districts, each with its own character and challenges. From the high-tech corporate towers to the overgrown parks and ancient ruins, players can explore a rich tapestry of environments. Services such as crafting stations, auction houses, banks, and quest hubs are scattered throughout the city.
*  **Visuals:** A blend of modern architecture with remnants of the Past and hints of Future tech. Skyscrapers with holographic advertisements, parks overgrown with ancient trees, and streets bustling with people and vehicles. The skyline is dotted with drones and air taxis, while the waterfront features a mix of modern marinas and ancient piers.
*   **Environmental Hazards:**
    *   **Temporal Anomalies:** Areas where time flows differently, causing confusion or disorientation.
    *   **Urban Decay:** Crumbling infrastructure, unstable buildings, and hazardous zones with toxic waste or rogue AI defenses.
    *   **Faction Conflicts:** Skirmishes between rival groups can erupt unexpectedly, creating dangerous situations.
*   **Inhabitants:**
    *   **Survivors:** A mix of modern humans, some with advanced tech implants or cybernetic enhancements.
    *   **Factions:** Various groups vying for control, such as corporate syndicates, scavenger gangs, and technomancers.
    *   **Rogue AI Constructs:** Remnants of pre-Collision technology that have become hostile.
    *   **Chrono-Walkers:** Individuals with the ability to navigate and manipulate time, often acting as mediators or enforcers.

    *   "Lost Relics": Search for ancient artifacts hidden in the city that hold clues to the origins of the Collision.
*   **Charactrer Level:** Starting zone (1-5)


### 2. Echo Vale - The Scar of Collision
*   **Eras Mixed:** All 3 (Past, Present, Future)
*   **Size:** Medium (10sq KM, chaotic landscape)
*   **Core Concept:** The chaotic, unstable ground zero where the three timelines first violently merged. Temporal storms constantly shift the landscape, and pockets of pure, unadulterated time from each era can spontaneously manifest and dissipate. All monsters in this zone are from all three eras, and from the common, uncommon, and rare categories. The zone is designed for individuals or groups of players to explore together.
*   **Visuals:** A shattered landscape. Crumbling medieval castle walls are impaled by twisted girders from a modern skyscraper, which itself is partially phased out by shimmering energy fields from a future megastructure. Patches of overgrown forest, cracked asphalt, and crystalline alien flora exist side-by-side. The sky is a maelstrom of colors, with rifts occasionally showing glimpses into other times.
*   **Environmental Hazards:**
    *   **Temporal Storms:** Areas where the dominant time period rapidly shifts, potentially buffing/debuffing players based on their own era (e.g., a Past character getting a boost in a "Past" pocket, but a debuff in a "Future" pocket). May also spawn era-specific temporary hazards (e.g., a hail of arrows, a burst of radiation, a laser grid).
    *   **Echoes:** Ghostly figures and events from different times replay themselves, sometimes harmless, sometimes manifesting as temporary hostile entities.
    *   **Unstable Terrain:** Ground that shifts, disappears, or changes properties.
*   **Inhabitants:**
    *   **Lost Souls:** Confused and desperate individuals from all three eras, often hostile.
    *   **Temporal Scavengers:** Creatures (and humanoids) that have adapted to the chaotic energies, preying on the weak.
    *   **Manifestations:** Purely temporal beings or constructs spawned by the storms.
    *   **Early Faction Scouts:** Representatives from small, fledgling groups trying to understand and survive the collision.
*   **Quest Hooks:**
    *   "Stabilize the Rift": Players help researchers deploy devices to temporarily calm small temporal storms.
    *   "Rescue the Lost": Find and escort stranded individuals to makeshift safe zones.
    *   "Echoes of the Past/Present/Future": Investigate specific, recurring temporal echoes to learn more about the collision or find lost artifacts.
    *   "Resource Scramble": Collect rare, erratically appearing resources unique to the Vale's unstable nature.
*   **Charactrer Level:** Likely a starting zone (1-5 or 1-10), but with dangerous, higher-level pockets that encourage return visits.

### 3. Neo-Babylon - The Ascended & The Ancient
*   **Eras Mixed:** Ancient + Future
*   **Size:** Medium (10sq KM, prawling city-state)
*   **Core Concept:** A magnificent, technologically advanced city-state from the Future, which, during the collision, materialized directly above and integrated with a sprawling complex of ancient ziggurats and temples from the Past. The future tech now powers and augments the ancient structures, creating a unique hybrid civilization. All monsters in this zone are ancient or future tech, and all elites and Legendary have 1+ class ultimates. The zone is designed for groups of players to explore together.
*   **Visuals:** Gleaming chrome and energy conduits snake around weathered stone ziggurats. Hover platforms dock at ancient archways. Holographic displays illuminate hieroglyph-covered walls. The city floats, tethered by massive energy beams to the ziggurat foundations, with cultivated hanging gardens spilling over both future-tech balconies and ancient stone ledges.
*   **Environmental Hazards:**
    *   **Power Fluctuations:** Areas where future-tech systems overload or ancient wards fail, causing energy discharges or magical traps.
    *   **Guard Drones/Constructs:** Automated defenses from both eras.
    *   **Vertigo:** Being a floating city, falling is a real danger.
*   **Inhabitants:**
    *   **Neo-Babylonians:** A society formed from the fusion. Perhaps a ruling class of Future-era humans who have embraced or subjugated the descendants of the Past-era inhabitants.
    *   **Ancient Guardians:** Magically animated statues or spirits bound to the ziggurats, now potentially augmented or corrupted by future tech.
    *   **Tech-Shamans/Priest-Engineers:** Individuals who blend ancient mysticism with future science.
    *   **Dissidents:** Those who resist the fusion or the ruling powers.
*   **Quest Hooks:**
    *   "The Power Core": Investigate instabilities in the city's power source, which might involve navigating both ancient magical wards and future security systems.
    *   "Whispers from Below": Explore the deeper, untouched levels of the ziggurats for ancient secrets or to quell restless spirits.
    *   "Cultural Exchange (or Conflict)": Mediate disputes or pick sides between factions representing the old ways and the new tech.
    *   "Artifact Fusion": Help a craftsman combine ancient relics with future components to create powerful new items.

### 4. Silicon Desert - The Wastes of Progress
*   **Eras Mixed:** Modern + Future
*   **Size:** Large (20sq KM, desolate expanse)
*   **Core Concept:** Once a bustling modern-day technological hub (think Silicon Valley), now a desolate, irradiated wasteland after its advanced AI research facilities went rogue during the collision, unleashing experimental future weaponry and nanites. Scavengers and desperate survivors pick through the ruins. All monsters in this zone are modern or future tech, and all have 1+ class ultimates. The zone is designed for groups of players to explore together.
*   **Visuals:** Sand-blasted ruins of skyscrapers, server farms, and research labs. Rusted husks of modern vehicles alongside sleek, damaged future-tech transports. Patches of the desert glow with eerie radiation or are covered in self-replicating grey goo (nanites). Makeshift settlements huddle in the shadows of colossal, inert war machines.
*   **Environmental Hazards:**
    *   **Radiation Zones:** Areas with high ambient radiation, causing damage over time.
    *   **Rogue AI Defenses:** Automated turrets, security bots, and deadly traps still active.
    *   **Nanite Swarms:** Clouds of microscopic robots that can deconstruct matter (including players) or cause bizarre mutations.
    *   **Sandstorms:** Reduce visibility and can carry hazardous materials.
*   **Inhabitants:**
    *   **Rogue AI Constructs:** From repurposed security bots to terrifying experimental war machines.
    *   **Scavenger Gangs:** Desperate groups of modern and future survivors fighting over scraps.
    *   **Mutated Wildlife:** Creatures warped by radiation and nanites.
    *   **Cyber-Nomads:** Tech-savvy survivors who have adapted to the harsh environment using salvaged future tech.

*   **Charactrer Level:** Mid-to-high level zone (e.g., 15-20, or a section scaling higher).

### 5. The Verdant Rift - Nature Reclaims, Strangely
*   **Eras Mixed:** Ancient + Modern
*   **Size:** Large (20sq KM, sprawling, overgrown area)
*   **Core Concept:** A deep chasm or valley where the collision caused an explosion of hyper-accelerated, unnatural growth. Ancient forests and jungles have violently erupted through modern towns and wilderness areas, with flora and fauna exhibiting bizarre mutations and luminescent properties, often with a "neon" or "bio-digital" aesthetic where nature mimics technology. There is a good mix of all monster categories, though uncommon and rare monsters are more common than common monsters. All monsters in this zone have 1+ class ultimates, and the zone is designed for groups of players to explore together.
*   **Visuals:** Towering, glowing trees with circuit-like patterns on their bark. Vines that pulse with light, ensnaring rusted cars and remnants of modern buildings. Ancient stone ruins overgrown with luminescent moss and flowers that emit strange energies. Rivers flow with glowing, alchemically altered water.
*   **Environmental Hazards:**
    *   **Aggressive Flora:** Carnivorous plants, entangling vines, spore-releasing fungi with various effects (hallucinations, poison, paralysis).
    *   **Unstable Ground:** Overgrown areas hiding pitfalls or quicksand-like bogs.
    *   **Wild Magic Zones:** Pockets where the ancient magic and modern pollutants have created unpredictable magical effects.
*   **Inhabitants:**
    *   **Mutated Wildlife:** Animals from both eras, now warped into fantastical and dangerous forms (e.g., giant insects with metallic carapaces, deer with glowing antlers that discharge energy).
    *   **Primal Cultists:** Modern humans who have regressed, worshipping the bizarre new nature, or ancient tribes empowered by it.
    *   **Dryads/Nature Spirits:** Beings from the ancient world, now altered and potentially hostile due to the unnatural fusion.
    *   **Lost Explorers/Scientists:** Modern era civillians have become trapped while studying the phenomenon, one of them might even be a chrono-walker.

### 6. Chrono Nexus - The Eye of the Storm
*   **Eras Mixed:** All 3 (Past, Present, Future) - Concentrated and Raw
*   **Size:** Massive (100sq KM, ever-shifting area)
*   **Core Concept:** The absolute epicenter of the temporal collision, a highly volatile and dangerous zone where the fabric of reality is thinnest. Only accessible to high-level, well-prepared players, this area holds profound secrets about the cataclysm and potentially the means to influence it. All monsters in this zone are extremely powerful, elite and legendary and have 2+ class ultimates.
*   **Visuals:** A breathtaking and terrifying spectacle. Islands of land from all three eras float in a swirling vortex of raw temporal energy. Fragments of buildings, landscapes, and even starfields from different times are suspended, phasing in and out. Crystallized time formations, rifts showing glimpses into pure past/present/future, and massive, enigmatic structures of unknown origin dominate the "sky."
*   **Environmental Hazards:**
    *   **Extreme Temporal Flux:** Constant, unpredictable shifts in game rules, enemy spawns, and environmental effects. Players might find their abilities suddenly enhanced or nullified.
    *   **Reality Tears:** Unstable rifts that can teleport players, deal massive damage, or summon powerful entities.
    *   **Chrono Radiation:** A unique form of energy that drains resources or inflicts bizarre debuffs. Chrono Radiation debuffs can also affect the player's primary and secondary attributes, reducing them, by up to 20 points, while the chrono walkers are in the zone.
    *   **Guardians of Time:** Powerful, enigmatic beings (The Vrathan) that protect the Nexus.
*   **Inhabitants:**
    *   **Chrono-Mummy:** The reanimated remains for slain chrono-walkers, now twisted by the Nexus's energies.
