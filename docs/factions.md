### 1. The Continuum Accord
#### Philosophy:
Seek to restore and protect the original flow of time.

#### Leader:
Magister Rephar Vell

##### Title:
The Last Timekeeper

##### Description:
Once a humble scholar of pre-Collision timelines, Rephar ascended through the Accord’s labyrinthine bureaucracy to become its guiding force. Stern, methodical, and bound by duty, he believes that time itself entrusted him with its restoration.

#### Tone:
Noble, lawful, preservationist.

#### Traits:
Bureaucratic, hierarchical, ritualistic.

#### Symbols:
Hourglass, spiral, ouroboros.

#### Tagline:
“There is only one true thread.”

#### Conflicts With:
##### The Fracturists
The Continuum Accord views the Fracturists as the greatest existential threat to temporal stability. Where the Accord seeks to heal time, the Fracturists tear at its seams with reckless experimentation and anti-structure ideology.

##### The Iridian Forge
Though both want to “fix” the timeline, the Accord believes the Forge is dangerously hubristic, pushing changes without regard for the true flow of time. Quiet ideological war simmers between them, with the Accord often trying to thwart the Forge's more radical plans.

#### Conflict Manifestations:
* Espionage against rogue research cells
* Assassinations of destabilizing Walkers
* Diplomatic sabotage of Iridian efforts to rally the fractured zones

### 2. The Fracturists
#### Philosophy:
Embrace the broken timelines; splinters bring opportunity.

#### Leader:
Mirror-Saint Kael

##### Title:
The Shattered Prophet

##### Description:
A former Accord archivist driven mad—or enlightened—by contact with a temporal fracture, Kael now leads the Fracturists with erratic charisma. They claim to have seen every possible future and insist that chaos is the only honest path forward.

#### Tone:
Chaotic-neutral, anarchic, revolutionary.

#### Traits:
Experimental, pragmatic, opportunistic.

#### Symbols:
Cracked mirror, broken clock face, prism.

#### Tagline:
“Break the rules. Break the cycle.”

#### Conflicts With:
##### The Continuum Accord
The Fracturists believe the Accord is clinging to a dead past. In their eyes, the old timeline is a cage, and anyone trying to restore it is an enemy of evolution.

##### The Parallax Order
Fracturists see them as cowardly fence-sitters, unwilling to seize the power laid bare by the Collision. They often clash over the nature of time and whether it should be manipulated or observed.

#### Conflict Manifestations:
* Temporal bombings of restored zones
* Open recruitment within Continuum territory
* Data corruption strikes on Parallax Archives

### 3. The Parallax Order
#### Philosophy:
Observe and manipulate timelines from the outside — maintain balance but never interfere directly unless absolutely necessary.

#### Leader:
Oris Vael

##### Title:
The Unblinking Eye

##### Description:
Rarely seen in person, Oris is said to exist outside normal time, communicating through fractured reflections or timeless scrolls. Cold and calculating, they believe the Order’s watchful neutrality is the only thing preventing total collapse.

#### Tone:
Mysterious, monastic, neutral.

#### Traits:
Observational, archivist, remote.

#### Symbols:
Eyes, triangles, astrolabes.

#### Tagline:
“We see what others cannot.”

#### Conflicts With:
##### The Iridian Forge
The Order believes the Forge's attempts to “remake time” are destabilizing the already fragile continuum. Though they rarely act, when they do, it is surgical and final.

##### The Echobound
The Parallax Order worries the Echobound may unintentionally awaken echoes too dangerous to control. They see them as mystics dabbling in powers they barely understand.

#### Conflict Manifestations:
* Quiet neutralization of rogue engineers or seers
* Strategic containment of Chrono-Rifts
* Temporal surveillance operations to track faction moves

### 4. The Echobound
#### Philosophy:
Draw power from temporal echoes — remnants of timelines that never were or are yet to be.

#### Leader:
Whisper-Revenant Thena

##### Title:
Speaker Of The Forgotten

##### Description:
Thena channels voices from forsaken timelines through haunting chants and shifting glyphs. Considered a prophet or a living echo herself, she views every lost moment as sacred—and wields memories like weapons or blessings.

#### Tone:
Occult, spiritual, otherworldly.

#### Traits:
Mystics, memory harvesters, temporal mediums.

#### Symbols:
Crescent moons, chimes, runes that shift shape.

#### Tagline:
“All moments live on.”

#### Conflicts With:
##### The Continuum Accord
The Accord sees them as dangerous dreamers meddling with spectral forces that cannot be quantified. The Echobound reject the Accord's rigidity, claiming it blinds them to higher truths.

##### The Parallax Order
The Echobound claim the Order’s refusal to act causes more harm than good, accusing them of apathy and moral decay.

#### Conflict Manifestations:
* Temporal hauntings
* Echo-pulse disruptions of Accord facilities
* Occult propaganda inscribed into timestreams

### 5. The Iridian Forge
#### Philosophy:
Reforge the timeline into something better — even if it means rewriting the past.

#### Leader:
Forge-Master Calrix Den'vo

##### Title:
Architect Of The Future

##### Description:
Bold, driven, and fiercely idealistic, Calrix leads the Forge like a general of time’s revolution. A former inventor turned radical, he sees time as raw material and will reshape it, no matter the cost—because to him, the alternative is stagnation.

#### Tone:
Revolutionary, determined, aggressive.

#### Traits:
Technomancers, time-engineers, idealists.

#### Symbols:
Anvil wrapped in gears, radiant sunburst, forge-fire.

#### Tagline:
“Time is what we make of it.”

#### Conflicts With:
##### The Continuum Accord
The Forge believes time must be reforged, not restored. The Accord's obsession with “purity” is, to them, a refusal to adapt and progress.

##### The Parallax Order
The Forge resents the Order’s omnipresence and passive judgment. They believe real change requires risk—and sacrifice.

#### Conflict Manifestations:
* Seizure of fractured zones for experimentation
* Targeted sabotage of Parallax observatories
* Recruiting promising Walkers away from Accord training camps
