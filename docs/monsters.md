# Monsters
This is an awesome request! Crafting a diverse bestiary is key to making a world feel alive and dangerous. Here's a list of 100 monsters, mixing legend, nightmare, and your unique chrono-collision theme, with attributes (Agility, Constitution, Strength, Intelligence, Spirit, Wisdom) to give a sense of their capabilities.

I've tried to vary their power levels and thematic origins (Past, Present, Future, and mixes). Attribute scores are on a rough scale where 10 is average human, and higher numbers indicate greater prowess.
