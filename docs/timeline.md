## The Collision (10:07AM Pacific Time)
**All timelines converge in a cataclysmic event orchestrated by the Vrathan. Reality fractures, merging eras and histories.**

## Post-Collision Timeline

- **Day 1:** Seattle survives as a bastion; dinosaurs roam city streets; cyborgs and legionnaires clash.
- **Week 1:** Factions form (Accord, Fracturists, Parallax Order, etc.); first temporal storms hit.
- **Month 1:** Emergence of Chrono-Walkers; first Paradox Broker bazaar opens. Marta Hahland announces her belief that the Collision was caused by the Vrathan, presenting her evidence at the Seattle Armory. Dr. Thorne Vale begins his controversial research into communicating with, rather than fighting, temporal entities.
- **Year 1:** The Chrono Nexus is discovered by a joint expedition hosted by the Continuum Accord, Jace Sonnefeld, and Marta Hahland, weeks later Jace died while exploring the Nexus, becoming the first known Chrono-Mummy; timeline anomalies intensify; Following a public and acrimonious debate with Marta Hahland over the nature of the Vrathan, Dr. Thorne Vale formally splits with Accord-aligned researchers to pursue his own theories on "symbiotic temporalism."
- **Year 2:** Steel Sentinels rise to power, enforcing order in fractured zones; Temporal Orphanage founded to shelter displaced children; Marta Hahland disappears without a trace from within a locked and windowless lab
- **Year 3:** First successful timeline repair attempts; Accord negotiates peace between rival factions; Era Bleed events increase, causing historical overlaps; Marta Hahland re-appears as a 96 year old. Hours later Marta Hahland disappears again.
- **Year 4:** Parallax Order uncovers Vrathan relics, sparking a race for control; Fracturists sabotage Nexus stabilization efforts; Marta Hahland re-appears as a 19 year old, but with all the memories of her past. Hours later Marta Hahland disappears again.
- **Year 5 (Current Game Era):** 
    - Marta Hahland re-appears, her right hand appears to be made of some kind of energy while her left hand appears to be made of wood, and hours later she disappears again.
    - The city is a patchwork of merged eras, with ancient, modern, and future districts.
    - Faction tensions simmer; Accord and Steel Sentinels maintain fragile peace.
    - Paradox storms and Era Bleed remain unpredictable threats.
    - Chrono-Walkers are now recognized as mediators and troubleshooters.
    - Vrathan influence is felt through mysterious events and cryptic messages.
    - New technologies and magics emerge from timeline fusion.
    - The Chrono Nexus is unstable, with rumors of a second Collision.
    - Players begin their journey, shaping the fate of the fractured world.

## Notes
- Events from all three timelines may echo, repeat, or overlap unpredictably in the fractured reality.
- Some quests/events may reference pre-Collision history, requiring players to piece together the past, present, or future to complete.
