**Chrono Nexus**  
The epicenter of the Collision, where timelines are weakest and reality is most malleable.

**Chrono-Mummy**
The cursed, reanimated remains of a Chrono-Walker who has fallen within the Chrono Nexus. Bound to the will of the Vrathan, these powerful undead guardians possess abilities that manipulate time and are a grave threat to any who enter their domain. The first Chrono-Mummy was Jace Sonnefeld.
