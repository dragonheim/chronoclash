## The Collision: A Fractured Reality
The Collision is the cataclysmic event that shattered the fabric of reality, merging three discreet timelines into a single, chaotic continuum. It is the origin of the Chrono-Walkers, those who traverse the fractured streams of time, seeking to understand and navigate the new world born from this temporal catastrophe.

The Collision occurred when the timelines of three distinct eras – the ancient past, the near future, and a distant, post-apocalyptic future – converged in a cataclysmic event. This convergence was not a natural occurrence but rather the result of an unknown force or entity, later identified as the Vrathan, who orchestrated this merging for reasons yet to be fully understood.

The event itself was a violent upheaval, a cosmic collision that tore apart the very fabric of existence. Time and space warped and twisted, creating a new reality where the laws of physics were inconsistent, and the boundaries between past, present, and future became blurred. The result was a world where ancient civilizations coexisted with futuristic technology, where dinosaurs roamed alongside remnants of advanced societies, and where the echoes of long-lost eras could be felt in every corner of this new reality.

## The Nature of the Collision
The Collision is not merely a historical event; it is the defining moment of existence in this new reality. It is the point where past, present, and future collided, creating a tapestry of overlapping timelines, each with its own history, culture, and potential. The result is a world where the laws of physics are inconsistent, where time can flow backward or sideways, and where the boundaries between eras blur.

## The Chrono-Walkers: Guardians of the Fractured Tapestry
The Chrono-Walkers are the inheritors of the Collision, a new breed of human capable of perceiving and manipulating the fractured timelines. They are not mere time travelers; they are temporal navigators, scholars, and warriors, dedicated to understanding the nature of the Collision and protecting the fragile threads of reality from further unraveling.
Chrono-Walkers possess a unique ability to perceive the echoes of past and future events, allowing them to navigate the chaotic streams of time. They can see glimpses of what was, what is, and what could be, granting them insights into the nature of reality that ordinary humans cannot comprehend. This ability is both a blessing and a curse, as it exposes them to the dangers of temporal anomalies and paradoxes that can arise from their actions.

Their abilities are a gift and a curse, allowing them to traverse the chaotic streams of time but also exposing them to the dangers of temporal anomalies, paradoxes, and the ever-present threat of the Vrathan, the enigmatic architects of the Collision.

## The Nature of the Collision
The Collision is not a singular event but a complex, multi-layered phenomenon. It is the result of multiple timelines converging, each with its own unique history and trajectory. The merging of these timelines has created a reality where the past, present, and future coexist in a state of flux, leading to a chaotic and unpredictable world.

The Collision has resulted in a fractured reality, where the laws of physics are inconsistent, and the boundaries between past, present, and future are blurred. Time can flow backward or sideways, and the echoes of long-lost eras can be felt in every corner of this new reality. This has led to the emergence of temporal anomalies, where events from different timelines intersect, creating unpredictable and often dangerous effects.

The Collision has not only altered the physical laws of the universe but has also reshaped the very fabric of existence. Time is no longer linear; it is a tangled web of possibilities, where events can influence each other across different eras. This has led to the emergence of new phenomena, such as temporal storms, where fragments of different timelines collide, creating unpredictable and often dangerous effects.

## The Chrono Nexus: Heart of the Collision
The Chrono Nexus is the epicenter of the Collision, a place where the boundaries between timelines are weakest and where the fabric of reality is most malleable. It is a realm of paradoxes, where time flows in multiple directions, and where the past, present, and future can be glimpsed simultaneously.

Many believe the Nexus is the most dangerous place in this new reality, a place where the Vrathan, the architects of the Collision, can be felt most strongly, but also a place where dead Chrono-Walkers rise up to defend the Vrathan. It is a place of power and mystery, where the Chrono-Walkers gather to study the nature of time and to seek answers to the questions that haunt them.

## Seattle: The last city
Seattle was somehow spared from the worst parts of the Collision, becoming a refuge for those who survived the initial chaos, a place where normal humans and Chrono-Walkers work together to prepare for the challenges ahead. While the rest of the world was torn apart, Seattle remained a bastion of hope and resilience, a place where the remnants of humanity could rebuild and adapt to the new reality.

## The Architects of Echoes: Legends of the Vrathan
The Collision was not an accident. This is the first, terrifying truth a **Chrono-Walker** internalizes, a shard of understanding amidst the temporal chaos. The present, fractured and bleeding moments from millennia past and future, is a deliberate construct. And its architects, the silent, unseen, and all-powerful entities whispered about in the fragmented chron-data streams and apochryphal texts, are known by a name that inspires both awe and a profound, existential dread: **The Vrathan**.

What are the Vrathan? No human, not even the most attuned Chrono-Walker, can say with certainty. They are not a race in any biological sense humans comprehend. The name itself, "Vrathan," is a linguistic fossil, pieced together from a dozen dead languages and echoed in the static between timelines. Some scholars of the temporal schism translate it as "Those Who Span," others as "The Unseen Current," and a more fearful few as "Time's Own Heartbeat, Stilled and Redirected." These translations hint at their nature: beings intrinsically tied to, or perhaps existing beyond, the normal flow and structure of causality.

Visual descriptions are rarer than stable pre-Collision artifacts. Those who claim to have glimpsed a Vrathan speak not of form, but of sensation – a profound cognitive dissonance, a bending of light and perception that the human mind struggles to process and often rejects. Some describe a shimmer at the edge of vision, a fleeting non-Euclidean geometry that vanishes when directly observed, leaving behind only a lingering scent of ozone and crushed paradox. Others recount a sudden, localized silence in the usually noisy timestream, a void where causality itself seemed to pause, and in that pause, an awareness was felt – ancient, vast, and utterly alien. The most common thread is that to truly see a Vrathan is to have one's understanding of reality momentarily unravel. Perhaps they exist in more dimensions than humans can perceive, and what is glimpsed is merely the faintest shadow of their true, unimaginable scope.

Their abilities, however, are the subject of countless legends, each more terrifying and awe-inspiring than the last. The Vrathan are not mere time travelers; they are Temporal Weavers of the highest order.

Imagine time not as a river, but as an infinite, multi-dimensional tapestry, each thread a possibility, an event, a lifeline of an entire universe. The Vrathan, it is said, do not merely observe this tapestry; they hold the shuttle and the shears. They can pluck individual threads – a moment, a decision, the birth of a star – and re-weave them, or snip them entirely from the fabric of what-could-be. The Collision itself is believed to be their grandest act of such weaving, a forcible knotting of disparate universal strands into a single, chaotic braid. Legends speak of them orchestrating entire epochs, not by direct intervention, but by nudging a single event millennia prior, the ripples of which cascade into precisely the future they desire. A Chrono-Walker might see a potential future, fight to achieve it, only to feel the timeline squirm and reconfigure around them, a Vrathan's unseen hand adjusting the cosmic loom.

This mastery extends to Reality Sculpting. Because time and space are intrinsically linked, the Vrathan's manipulation of one invariably affects the other. They are said to fold space by compressing time, creating impossible distances or instantaneous connections. They can allegedly solidify paradoxes into physical barriers, regions where the laws of physics become suggestions rather than rules. Some Chrono-Walkers whisper of "Vrathan Folds" – pocket dimensions existing outside the normal timestream, perhaps their workshops or observation posts, where the very passage of moments is alien. To enter such a fold is to risk being unwritten from history or aged to dust in the blink of an eye.

Their most insidious and perhaps most potent ability is their influence over Cognitive and Causal Integrity. The Vrathan do not always need to manifest or directly act to prevent humans from "fixing" the Collision. Why use a hammer when a whisper will suffice? It is theorized they can introduce subtle dissonances into the timestream, like a discordant note in a grand symphony, that subtly guide thoughts and actions. A brilliant scientist on the verge of understanding a piece of the temporal puzzle might suddenly lose their train of thought, their notes might inexplicably corrupt, or they might be plagued by an unshakeable, erroneous conviction that leads them down a fruitless path. Historical records accessed by Chrono-Walkers seeking clues about the Vrathan or the original state of their timelines have been known to change subtly between viewings, key dates shifting, names altering, as if the Vrathan are actively curating the past to obscure their tracks and intent. They may not erase memories, but they can plant the seeds of doubt, misdirection, and even self-sabotage within the minds of those who would defy their design.

But why? Why orchestrate the Collision? Why shatter countless realities only to meticulously maintain the resulting chaos? This is the greatest mystery surrounding the Vrathan, the question that gnaws at every Chrono-Walker. Theories abound, each more unsettling than the last:

  1. **The Great Filter or Pruning:** Some believe the Vrathan are cosmic gardeners, and the timelines they merged were, in their estimation, diseased, stagnant, or leading to an undesirable ultimate fate. The Collision is a violent, desperate attempt to prune away these "failed" branches of reality, hoping a stronger, more viable trunk will emerge from the trauma.

  2. **The Harmonic Experiment:** Others posit that the Vrathan perceive a higher-order reality, a symphony of existence that had fallen out of tune. The Collision, with its cacophony of colliding eras, is their attempt to force a new, more complex, and ultimately more "correct" harmonic resonance, even if the process is destructive to the individual notes (i.e., lives and civilizations).

  3. **The Unfathomable Escape:** A darker theory suggests the Vrathan themselves are fleeing something even more terrifying, something that exists beyond the known multiverse. The Collision might be an act of desperation, a way to create a chaotic, unpredictable reality that their pursuers cannot navigate, or a complex shield woven from the very fabric of broken time.

  4. **The Artists of Existence:** Perhaps the most alien concept is that the Vrathan are artists, and time itself is their medium. The Collision is their masterpiece, a breathtaking, terrible, and beautiful expression of their power and vision. Human suffering and confusion are, from this perspective, merely incidental colors on their vast canvas.

  5. **The Necessary Catalyst:** Could it be that the Vrathan foresee a stagnation or self-destruction for all timelines if left isolated? Perhaps the Collision, for all its horror, is a crucible designed to force evolution, to birth something new – like Chrono-Walkers themselves – capable of perceiving and navigating a more complex cosmos.

Regardless of their motives, the Vrathan are not passive architects. They are the Silent Wardens of the Collision. While their direct interventions are rare and often cataclysmic when they occur, their influence is constant. Temporal storms that shift landscapes and empower era-specific entities might be subtle adjustments of their grand design. The "Guardians of Time" encountered in the Chrono Nexus are believed by some to be their direct servitors, or perhaps lesser Vrathan, tasked with protecting the epicenters of temporal instability. They represent the ultimate obstacle to any attempt to restore or "fix" what has been so deliberately unmade.

To face the Vrathan is not to face a mere enemy; it is to confront the very nature of time, causality, and reality. They are the enigma at the heart of the shattered world, their motives as obscure as their forms, their power as vast as time itself. For the Chrono-Walkers, discovering the truth of the Vrathan is not just a matter of curiosity; it is intrinsically linked to the fate of all timelines, the survival of humanity, and the desperate, perhaps impossible, hope of choosing a future from the echoes of the past. Their awesome abilities are the very laws of the new, broken reality, and understanding them is the first step towards navigating – and perhaps, one day, defying – their inscrutable will.

## Jace Sonnefeld
### The First Descent
Jace Sonnefeld had always felt the pull of time. It was a sensation that came to him in dreams—fractured glimpses of events he could not explain, moments that did not belong to his life but somehow felt familiar. When the Collision came, when reality shattered and twisted into something unrecognizable, Jace discovered that he was different. He was a Chrono-Walker, one of the few gifted—or cursed—with the ability to navigate the fractured streams of time. But even among his kind, Jace’s connection to the timestream was unique. He could feel it more acutely than most, as though time itself whispered to him, guiding his steps through the chaos.

His first mission as a Chrono-Walker was to venture into the Chrono Nexus, the epicenter of the Collision. It was a place spoken of in hushed tones, where the boundaries between timelines were weakest and where the fabric of reality was most malleable. Many who entered never returned, lost in the shifting currents of time or consumed by the paradoxes that thrived there. For Jace, it was both a test and a rite of passage—a chance to prove himself worthy of the title he now bore.

The journey to the Nexus was perilous. Time flowed erratically in its vicinity, twisting the landscape into an ever-changing mosaic of eras. One moment, Jace walked through the ruins of a futuristic city, its towering skyscrapers reduced to skeletal remains by forces unknown. The next, he found himself in a prehistoric jungle, where dinosaurs roamed freely alongside the remnants of advanced technology from a time that should not have existed. The air shimmered with temporal energy, crackling like static electricity, warping his perception of space and time.

As he approached the heart of the Nexus, Jace felt the weight of countless timelines pressing down on him. The air grew heavier, thick with the echoes of history—whispers of lives lived and lost, of futures that might have been, and of possibilities yet to unfold. The ground beneath his feet shifted unpredictably, alternating between ancient stone and metallic flooring from a distant era. Time itself seemed to breathe around him, pulsing with a rhythm that only he could hear.

At the center of the Nexus, Jace encountered the first of many trials. A temporal storm erupted before him, a swirling vortex of energy that tore through the fabric of reality. Within the storm, fragments of different timelines collided, creating unpredictable and often dangerous effects. Jace watched as figures from the past and future emerged from the chaos, their forms flickering like ghosts caught between moments. Some reached out to him, their voices pleading for help, while others attacked without warning, driven by motives he could not understand.

Jace knew he had to press forward. Drawing upon his abilities, he focused on the flow of time around him, allowing himself to perceive the threads of causality that connected each fragment of reality. With careful precision, he wove his way through the storm, avoiding paradoxes and navigating the treacherous currents of time. Each step brought him closer to the heart of the Nexus, where the true nature of the Collision awaited discovery.

At last, Jace reached the core of the Nexus—a vast chamber where the boundaries between past, present, and future collapsed entirely. Here, time flowed in multiple directions simultaneously, creating a kaleidoscope of overlapping realities. In the center of the chamber stood a monolithic structure, its surface etched with symbols that pulsed with an otherworldly light. As Jace approached, he felt the presence of something ancient and powerful—an intelligence that transcended time itself.

It was then that he understood. The Vrathan were real, their influence woven into the very fabric of the Collision. They were not merely architects of this fractured reality; they were its guardians, its weavers, its silent observers. And they were watching.

Jace’s mind reeled as he absorbed the enormity of what lay before him. The knowledge threatened to overwhelm him, but he held firm, grounding himself in the present moment. He had come to the Nexus seeking answers, and now he had them—but at what cost?

As the chamber trembled around him, Jace realized that his journey was far from over. The Collision had changed the world forever, and his role in unraveling its mysteries had only just begun. With a final glance at the monolith, he turned and stepped back into the chaos of the Nexus, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.

For Jace Sonnefeld, the path of a Chrono-Walker had truly begun.

### The Birth of the First Chrono-Mummy
Jace Sonnefeld had ventured deeper into the Chrono Nexus than any Chrono-Walker before him. He had seen the truth—the Vrathan, the architects of the Collision, the silent weavers of time’s unraveling. But knowledge came at a cost.

As he stood before the monolithic structure at the heart of the Nexus, the air around him thick with the weight of countless timelines collapsing inward, Jace felt something shift. A presence—vast, alien, and utterly beyond comprehension—descended upon him. It was not a physical form, not in any way he could define. It was awareness, a ripple in the timestream that bent reality to its will.
  
The Vrathan did not speak—not in words, not in thought—but it acted . With a single gesture that existed outside the bounds of causality, it reached into Jace, unraveling his very essence. Time recoiled from his body as though rejecting its own reflection. His breath caught mid-inhale, his heartbeat stuttered, and then—

Stillness.

Not death. Not life.

Something else entirely.

His body collapsed inward, wrapped in the echoes of itself across multiple timelines. Bandages of temporal after-images coiled around his limbs, flickering between moments—his birth, his training, his final steps into the Nexus. His soul, tethered by forces unknown, did not pass on but remained bound within this fractured shell.

He rose again.

No longer Jace Sonnefeld, no longer a Chrono-Walker.

A Chrono-Mummy.

The first of its kind.

### The Awakening
The Nexus trembled as Jace—or what remained of him—awoke. His once-human eyes were now voids of shifting light, reflecting every version of himself that ever was or could have been. Where once he walked with purpose, he now lurched forward with unnatural speed, each movement leaving behind a ripple in time itself.

From the shadows emerged creatures twisted by the same temporal forces that had reformed him—cybernetic beasts stitched together from lost eras, their howls distorted by the flow of fractured time. They bowed before him, recognizing his new nature. He was no longer just a man who could walk through time.

He was a guardian of the Nexus.

A harbinger of the Vrathan’s will.

### The Legacy of the Fallen
Word spread among the Chrono-Walkers of Seattle: Jace had not returned. Some believed he had been consumed by paradox, others that he had transcended into something beyond human understanding. But those who dared enter the Nexus again would come to know the truth.

In the deepest chambers, where time spiraled in chaotic eddies and the past whispered warnings to the present, they found him. A figure wrapped in flickering bandages, moving with eerie grace. Those who faced him learned too late the meaning of the Curse of Ages , a rot that aged flesh and mind alike, reducing the strong to dust and the wise to madness.

And when a Chrono-Walker fell before him, their echoes rose once more—spectral forms of the dead, summoned by the power that now ruled him. Their voices cried out in anguish, trapped in the cycle of time’s rejection, forced to serve the will of the one who had come before them.

Jace had become legend.

A monster born of time’s betrayal.

The first Chrono-Mummy.

And the warning to all who would follow.
