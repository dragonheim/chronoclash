Considerations for Damage Calculation:
Now that you have base damage for weapons, you'll need a damage formula. A common approach is:
Final Damage = (Weapon_Base_Damage + (Character_Total_AP * AP_to_Damage_Conversion_Factor)) * (1 - (Target_Armor_Value / (Target_Armor_Value + Armor_Effectiveness_Constant))) * Other_Multipliers
Weapon_Base_Damage: The values listed above.
Character_Total_AP: Character's AP from stats + Weapon's Base AP bonus.
AP_to_Damage_Conversion_Factor: How much 1 AP adds to damage (e.g., 0.5, 1.0).
Target_Armor_Value: Enemy's Armor.
Armor_Effectiveness_Constant: A value that determines how effective armor is (e.g., if it's 1000, then 1000 armor reduces damage by 50%).
Other_Multipliers: Critical hits, damage type resistances/vulnerabilities, buffs/debuffs.
This list provides a good spread. You can now start thinking about how these damage numbers interact with the monster HP values you've established and tune them accordingly. For instance, if a Level 10 character with the Time-Warped Gladius is hitting common Level 10 monsters, how many hits should it take to defeat them? This will guide the balancing of weapon damage vs. monster HP.
